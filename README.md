# üé¨ Movie Hit or Flop Prediction ETL Pipeline

A Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to collect, process, and analyze movie data to predict whether a movie will be a hit or a flop. The pipeline integrates data from various sources, performs necessary transformations, stores the data in both CSV files and a MySQL database, and utilizes machine learning models for prediction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed
* MySQL server installed and running
* TMDb API key

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-hit-flop-prediction.git
   cd movie-hit-flop-prediction
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your TMDb API key and MySQL credentials:

   ```
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_db_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=movie_db
   ```

5. **Initialize the Database**

   * Create a new database named `movie_db` in MySQL.
   * Run the provided SQL scripts to create necessary tables.

6. **Run the ETL Pipeline**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Pipeline Architecture

The ETL pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Extraction**: Scripts (`extractViews.py`, `extractLikes.py`, `extractComments.py`) fetch data from TMDb API and IMDb datasets.
2. **Transformation**: The `transform.py` script processes the raw data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and engineering features like ROI.
3. **Loading**: The `load.py` script saves the transformed data into CSV files and inserts records into the MySQL database.
4. **Prediction**: The `predict.py` script trains machine learning models to predict movie success.
5. **Visualization**: The `visualize.py` script generates graphs to analyze data distributions and model performance.

The `main.py` script orchestrates the entire pipeline, utilizing threading to run extraction scripts concurrently.
